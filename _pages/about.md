Hi there! I am currently an MPhil student in Artificial Intelligence at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Ying Sun](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/SUN-Ying/yings) and [Prof. Hui Xiong](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/hui-xiong/).

Previously, I received my M.Sc. in Mathematics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk).

My research interests lie in large language model compression, LLM interpretability, and LLM architecture. I’m especially interested in how principled mathematical tools can help us understand and improve modern AI systems.

When I’m not coding or reading papers, I enjoy hiking, badminton, squash, reading novels, and writing technical posts.
